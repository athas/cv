\section{Personal information}

\textbf{Citizenship:} Danish---
\textbf{Born:} 23rd of November, 1987---
\textbf{Languages:} Fluent in Danish and English

\section{Education}

Bachelors (2010), masters (2014), and PhD (2017) degrees in computer
science from DIKU, at the University of Copenhagen.

\section{Research Interests in Computing}

The software-hardware boundary, in particular mapping high-level
language concepts efficiently onto parallel and distributed systems or
accelerators.  Motivated by combining theory, practice, and solid
engineering, to produce systems that \textit{actually work}, rather
than being fragile proofs of concepts.

\section{Academic and Work experience}

\begin{description}
\item[2009--2014]: TA in various DIKU courses ($16$ positions in
  total), in many cases participating in censor meetings.
\item[2014--2017]: PhD student at DIKU.
\item[2017--]: Post-doctoral researcher at DIKU.
\end{description}

No prior work as a censor.

Additionally:

\begin{description}
\item[March 2013--March 2014:] Student programmer/research assistant as
  part of the \L{} project at DIKU, developing the \LO{} language and
  compiler (now Futhark).
\item[July 2014:] Intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
  (LLNL), where I worked on a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded
  in C++ and generating CUDA code, for expressing problems in
  molecular dynamics.
\item[February 2017--March 2017:] Intern at the Danish company
  SimCorp, where I ported a Heston calibration program from OCaml to
  Futhark.
\end{description}


\section{Publication Summary}

Several articles in international peer-reviewed conference proceedings
and journals, including premiere venues such as PLDI, TACO, ICFP, and
PPoPP.  The majority of my work centres on studying optimising
compilers for high-level languages, in particular in conjunction with
the Futhark project.\footnote{\url{https://futhark-lang.org}}
