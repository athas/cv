\section{Personal information}

\textbf{Citizenship:} Danish---
\textbf{Born:} 23rd of November, 1987---
\textbf{Languages:} Fluent in Danish and English

\section{Education}

BSc (2010), MSc (2014), and PhD (2017) in computer science from the
University of Copenhagen.

\section{Research Interests in Computing}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{software-hardware boundary}, in particular mapping
  high-level language concepts efficiently onto \textbf{parallel and
    distributed systems} or
  accelerators. \cite{Henriksen:2017:FPF:3062341.3062354,Henriksen:2019:IFN:3293883.3295707,Larsen:2017:SRS:3122948.3122952,10.1145/2898354}
\item The combination of \textbf{high-performance computing} and
  \textbf{high-productivity computing}.~\cite{giesekemassively,lindh2019a,10.1145/3331553.3342617,Elsman:2019:DFE:3315454.3329955}
\item I am motivated by combining \textbf{theory, practice, and solid
    engineering}, to demonstrate ideas that \textit{actually
    work}.\cite{Henriksen:2017:FPF:3062341.3062354,Henriksen:2019:IFN:3293883.3295707,Elsman:2018:SIH:3243631.3236792,10.1007/978-3-030-18506-0_7}
\end{itemize}

As an applied researcher, I put significant effort into making my work
useful to others.  The Futhark language has been used for teaching and
projects at several universities (to my knowledge DIKU, Chalmers, and
HEPIA), as well as some ``real world'' usage.

\section{Academic and Work Experience}

\begin{description}
\item[2009--2014]: TA in various DIKU courses ($16$ positions in total).
\item[2014--2017]: PhD student at DIKU.
\item[2017--]: Post-doctoral researcher at DIKU.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Program committees:] FHPC 18, ARRAY 19, MCC 18/19
\item[Artifact evaluation committees:] PPoPP 19
\item[External review committees:] ICFP 19/20
\item[Chair of:] VMCAI-AE 21, FHPNC 21
\end{description}

\section{Publication Summary}

I have authored and co-authored several articles in international
peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals, including premiere
venues such as PLDI, TACO, ICFP, PPoPP, and ICDE.  The majority of my
work centres on studying optimising compilers for high-level
languages, in particular in conjunction with the Futhark
project.\footnote{\url{https://futhark-lang.org}} I have also
participated in collaborative works where my research was applied in
practice to computational problems in medical imaging and data
science.
